## About the project
This "Simple Google Clone" project is a web application that mimics the basic functionality of the Google search engine. The project is built using React JS, Material UI, and LocalStorage.


The "Simple Google Clone" project allows users to search for information on the internet using a search bar. The search bar is built using React JS and Material UI. When the user submits a query, the application makes an API call using { SERPSTACK } to a search engine and returns a OBJECT of relevant results which gets stored in the localStorage. These results are displayed on the page using Material UI's pre-built components.
